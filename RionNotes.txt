Trying to keep this notes for my 8 year old nephew visiting me in his vacations in a couple of weeks.
He is excited about coding and am sure that comes more from knowing the buzz word these days in schools.
Not sure how I will be explaining vs keeping the interest alive so putting down some notes to see how it goes.
All rough notes for myself to have a sense of whats been told makes sense to him and how to structure.


###### Explain Browsers :
Step 1) Talk about browsers 
        open the same websites in diff browsers - help explain what is CONTENT and how browsers behave and show results to us
        
Step 2) Talk File / Edit / Options / Bookmarks
        The Alt- key
        Zoom and other shorcuts
        
Step 3) [Exercise-Test] Exercise to try all options above in another browser.

Step 4) Dev Tools

#######  CH-01 : pre-requisites
 Step 1) What are xml start/end tags to understand the base of html.
 Step 2) [Exercise-Test] for start tag and end tag
         Variant of end tag
 Step 3) Explaing the need to learn few concepts first which will take some time to understand first
        coding - variables / special words(keywords)
        coding - functions / function syntax 
        coding - use of () . ;
        coding - some special commands
                 console.log()
 
  
####### CH-02
1. https://www.plunkr.co 
   Explain the interface and key commands. 

2. and create a base template
   Understand the key files
    index.html  --> how this refers to the script.js  where our programming starts
    script.js   --> play on
   [Exercise-Test] - see how the out put can be seen , just how to use this no explanation of code
   
####### CH-03 : String / Numbers / Simple Operators
  Step 1)  Strings
          "Hello World"  'Hello World'  "Hello World!"  - prefer using double quotes.
  Step 2) Numbers 
            not using quotes
  Step 3) Simple Operators
            +  -  /  *  
            % --> Javascript treats this a remainder 
            ()
            
  Step 4) [Exercise-Test] - Add / subtract divide for numbers
          let number1 = 10;
          let number2 = 5;
          let answer;
            answer = number1 + number2;
            console.log(answer);
          
          ** give simple maths problem to be solved via code  
          ** BODMAS logic if already taught at school
          ** Give seperate 10 questions ( to check repeat coding ) and acheive results and show results 
             (12 +7) * 10 
             (457*23) etc
            
            
  Step 5) [Exercise-Test] - Add or concatenate for string using "" only
    let firstName= "Satadru",
    lastName= "Basu";
    console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
   
  ####### CH-04 : Comments
      //       - comment till end of line wherever it starts
      /*   */  - start and end mark
