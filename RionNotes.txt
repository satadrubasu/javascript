Trying to keep this notes for my 8 year old nephew visiting me in his vacations in a couple of weeks.
He is excited about coding and am sure that comes more from knowing the buzz word these days in schools.
Not sure how I will be explaining vs keeping the interest alive so putting down some notes to see how it goes.
All rough notes for myself to have a sense of whats been told makes sense to him and how to structure.
